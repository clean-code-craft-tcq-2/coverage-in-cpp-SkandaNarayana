# Prove and Cover the code

This project uses the
[catch framework](https://github.com/catchorg/Catch2/blob/master/docs/tutorial.md#top)
to test functionality.

## The task

Code coverage is low. Expand the tests to take care of the variations. Track and improve the coverage.

Hint: Test the abstractions, instead of just end-to-end tests.

Uncovered lines indicate an opportunity to write tests.

> Caution: High coverage doesn't indicate no bugs!
